# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques 
#### Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting
My attempt is in housePrice.ipynb. It is properly documented. My earlier and more messier attempt is in firstAttempt.ipynb. <br>
I'd appreciate any suggestions to improve the model. Also, any resource suggestion to learn further is appreciated. <br>
Thank you!
